# Integrating C2VSIM-FG, Borelogs, and CASGEM to Identify Gaining and Losing Stream Reaches in California's Central Valley

Understanding stream-aquifer interactions is critical for groundwater sustainability agencies to achieve their management
goals. This dashboard leverages public datasets and open source tools (C2VSIM-FG, CASGEM, and DWR's AEM borelogs) to 
identify gaining and losing reaches under various hydrologic conditions. In this dashboard, we use public datasets such 
as C2VSIM-FG, CASGEM, and the borelogs from DWR's AEM survey to compare observed vs simulated  groundwater levels in 
streams, compare them against streambed elevation, and characterize the interaction between the streams and the 
underlying aquifers. Animated transects offer stakeholders an intuitive way to visualize groundwater levels relative to 
streambed elevations.
