    "# Conclusions\n",
    "We developed a Python-based workflow that integrates open datasets of simulated and observed groundwater levels,\n",
    "lithology logs, and bathymetry to generate animated transects along the Sacramento River. These visualizations provide\n",
    "an intuitive way to explore groundwaterâ€“surface water interactions, revealing significant spatial and temporal\n",
    "heterogeneity. The river alternates between gaining and losing conditions across multiple locations, with seasonal\n",
    "patterns and differences between water year types.\n",
    "\n",
    "Future improvements include refining the transect using bathymetry-informed alignment, incorporating interpolated\n",
    "stage time series from stream gages, and adding quantitative indicators such as the fraction of time each segment\n",
    "is gaining or losing.\n"
