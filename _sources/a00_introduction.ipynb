    "# Introduction\n",
    " Over the past decade, SGMA implementation in California has generated vast amounts of observed and simulated data.\n",
    " Presenting these data in a meaningful, intuitive, and transparent way requires advanced processing and visualization\n",
    " tools. However, most mainstream tools are proprietary, leading to recurring license costs and limited flexibility.\n",
    "\n",
    " The widespread adoption of high-level programming such as Python and R has enabled the development of open-source\n",
    " libraries that support customizable workflowsâ€”from data processing and visualization to interactive dashboards.\n",
    "\n",
    " In this work, we present a Python-based workflow to integrate public datasets of observed and simulated groundwater\n",
    " levels, lithology logs, and bathymetry, to create animated stream transects for the Sacramento River. These animations\n",
    " help assess stream-groundwater connectivity under varied hydrologic conditions varied lithologies. The workflow is\n",
    " customizable and replicable for other streams across California's Central Valley."
