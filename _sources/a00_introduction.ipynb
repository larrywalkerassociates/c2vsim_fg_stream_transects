    "# Introduction\n",
    "- Problem Statement:\n",
    "   - 10 years of SGMA have generated large amounts of field and modeling data\n",
    "   - Presenting these data in a meaningful, intuitive, and transparent way requires sophisticated and highly customizable\n",
    "     visualization tools\n",
    "   - Mainstream tools are propietary, resulting in license costs and limited flexibility for users\n",
    " - Why it is important:\n",
    "   - Field and simulated data is of limited use if it cannot be effectively communicated to stakeholders and used\n",
    "     for decision-making\n",
    "   - When processing data, the devil often lies in the details, which proprietary tools often obscure making it difficult\n",
    "     to peer-review and recreate workflows\n",
    "   - High-level programming languages (e.g., Python, R) provide a wide array of open-source and accessible tools that\n",
    "     can be used to streamline data processing, visualization, and dashboard deployment for engineers and scientists.\n",
    " - How we have approached it (in general terms):\n",
    "   - We have developed a Python-based workflow to process public groundwater levels, lithology logs, bathymetry, and\n",
    "     simulated groundwater levels, displaying them in animated stream transects, which are deployed as dashboards.\n",
    "  - What is new about what we have done:\n",
    "    - Integrating multiple open-source datasets into one type of visualization\n",
    "    - Customizable and transparent workflow that can be replicated at other streams in the Central Valley with low\n",
    "      effort"
