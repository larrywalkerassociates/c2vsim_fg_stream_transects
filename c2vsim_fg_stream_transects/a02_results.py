# # Results
# The Sacramento River bed elevation ranges from approximately 250 ft to -25 ft (amsl) along the study transect, with a
# steeper slope toward Red Bluff. Comparing river bathymetry with simulated and observed groundwater levels provides a
# straightforward indicator of stream–aquifer interactions: when groundwater levels are above the streambed, the river
# is likely gaining; when below, it is likely losing. If the groundwater
# levels plot above the streambed, we expect the flow to occur from the aquifer towards the river. In turn, if the
# groundwater table plots below the bathymetry, we expect flow to occur from the river towards the underlying aquifer.
#
# Our analysis shows a highly dynamic system, with both gaining and losing reaches present across all three transects.
# Seasonal variability is pronounced: spring months exhibit the longest stretches of gaining reaches, which transition
# to losing reaches in the fall. Interannual variability is also significant—segments that gain flow during wet years
# often become losing reaches during critical years. The animations in this section illustrate these spatial and
# temporal patterns, highlighting how hydrologic conditions and lithology influence stream–groundwater connectivity.
