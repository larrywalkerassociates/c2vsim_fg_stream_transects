# # Conclusions
# We developed a Python-based workflow that integrates open datasets of simulated and observed groundwater levels,
# lithology logs, and bathymetry to generate animated transects along the Sacramento River. These visualizations provide
# an intuitive way to explore groundwaterâ€“surface water interactions, revealing significant spatial and temporal
# heterogeneity. The river alternates between gaining and losing conditions across multiple locations, with seasonal
# patterns and differences between water year types.
#
# Future improvements include refining the transect using bathymetry-informed alignment, incorporating interpolated
# stage time series from stream gages, and adding quantitative indicators such as the fraction of time each segment
# is gaining or losing.
